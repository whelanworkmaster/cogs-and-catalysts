# Project Agent Instructions

First step: open and read `currentprogress.md` to understand the latest project status before doing anything else.

After making any code or content changes, run headless validation via:
`powershell -File tools\debug_headless.ps1`
If it fails, review the output and `godot.log`, then attempt to fix errors before responding.
